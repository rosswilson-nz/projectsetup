<!-- Load any appendices etc. so targets can track dependencies -->
<!-- The resulting Typst file is included in the output via the metadata -->
<!-- Remove the leading // in the #include line in 'include-after-body' above -->

# Results

<!-- `ttab()` and `tfig()` produce raw Typst output, so wrap these in raw Typst blocks: -->
```{=typst}
{{< include _tables/table-1.qmd >}}
```

```{=typst}
{{< include _figures/figure-1.qmd >}}
```
